            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Casa Salitre! This guide is meant to make your
            stay as nice as possible, giving you general information
            about the location, amenities and appliances, access and
            what to do in town and the surroundings.</p>
            <h2 id="access-by-car">Access by car</h2>
            <p>Casa Salitre is located in the old-town of Salobreña.
            Here is how to access and park as smooth as possible.</p>
            <p><img src="./img/map.low.jpeg" class="border rounded"/></p>
            <p>You can find the longer version below, but if you’re in a
            hurry here is a <a
            href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/&#39;&#39;/36.7421149,-3.5876757/36.7405093,-3.5876583/36.7412835,-3.5875691/36.7410881,-3.5891981/@36.7429609,-3.5909107,16z/data=!4m12!4m11!1m5!1m1!1s0xd718fe1b1492be7:0x381a280809a7ddfa!2m2!1d-3.5828317!2d36.7466969!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e0?entry=ttu">link
            to Google Maps</a>, which will bring you from the
            round-about just at the entry of the town to the Radio
            Station, which is a convenient space to park and reach Casa
            Salitre.</p>
            <p>I still recommend you to have a look at the instructions
            below, to get familiarized with the environment.</p>
            <h3 id="summary-of-the-climb">Summary of the climb</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><p>From the round-about at the entry, go straight on
            Avd. Federico García Lorca until the round-about to take
            Carretera de la Playa.</p></li>
            <li><p>Keep straight until the cross-road in front of the
            Hostel Mary-Tere.</p></li>
            <li><p>From there, start going up on the “Calle del
            Rosario”. Keep going up, always following the signs for
            “A.T. Faldas del Castillo” (see the pictures in the
            following section).</p></li>
            <li><p>There will be 3 curves before you reach the top. When
            you reach the top, you’ll pass by the building of the Radio
            Station (a rounded building that looks a bit like an
            UFO).</p></li>
            <li><p>Best places to park are near the Radio Station and
            the parking next to it.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <li>From the cross-roads in front of Hostal Mary-Tere (to

            <h3 id="getting-out-by-car">Getting out by car</h3>
            <p>Going out is easier since there is only one way. From the
            radio keep going in the direction you came in and follow the
            signs.</p>
            <h2 id="reaching-the-house">Reaching the house</h2>
            <p>The house is in the east part of the old town, in a up
            and coming neighborhood. The entry is on street Calle
            Oriente, which consists mostly of stairs.</p>
            <h3 id="access-to-the-house">Access to the house</h3>
            <p>The access is on Calle Oriente, which connects the square
            of the Radio Station with Calle Ladera de la Cruz. If you
            are coming by car, chances are that you parked near the
            Radio Station. Even if you haven’t, it’s really nice to
            reach the point and enjoy the views over the Mediterranean
            Sea from the Viewpoint “Mirador Enrique Morente”.</p>
            <p>Looking at the door of the Radio Station, check to your
            left for the stairs going down (Calle Oriente), as the red
            arrow shows. After going down for a few minutes, Casa
            Salitre will be on your right. See pictures below.</p>
            <p><img src="./img/5-radio-oriente.low.jpeg" class="border rounded" />
            <img src="./img/entry.low.jpeg" class="border rounded" /></p>
            <h3 id="check-in">Check-in</h3>
            <p>Check-in is done using a safe box which you’ll find on
            the right side when looking at the door. I’ll make sure to
            send you the code on the day of your arrival.</p>
            <h2 id="amenities-appliances">Amenities &amp;
            Appliances</h2>
            <p>A quick summary of what you should find at home upon
            arrival.</p>
            <h3 id="bathroom">Bathroom</h3>
            <p>I’ve arranged it for hand-soap, shampoo, shower gel and
            conditioner, which you’ll find in the bathroom. I’ll make my
            best to ensure that they are always full.</p>
            <p>There should be two sets of towels below the bathroom
            sink.</p>
            <h3 id="living-room-kitchen">Living room &amp; Kitchen</h3>
            <p>Feel free to use the TV and AC. You’ll find the
            controllers in the first drawer of the white table below the
            TV.</p>
            <p>I ask you to be responsible with the usage of the AC,
            please always keep the doors and windows closed and switch
            it off at night. Thanks to its orientation and insulation,
            the apartment stays cool at night, even in the hottest days
            of summer.</p>
            <p>There is LED light in the kitchen. The switch is to the
            left of the worktop when you are looking towards the
            kitchen.</p>
            <h3 id="wifi">WIFI</h3>
            <p>The wifi name is <code>houdini</code> and the password is
            <code>escapingcat!</code>.</p>
            <h2 id="fun">Fun</h2>
            <p>Should you be looking for something to do or where to eat
            while in Salobreña, I’ve compiled a list of my favorites.
            Hope you enjoy it.</p>
            <h3 id="walking-around">Walking around</h3>
            <p>Everything in the old town is within walking distance. I
            invite you to walk around and get lost in its charming
            narrow streets. Everywhere is pretty safe to walk.</p>
            <h4 id="moorish-castle">Moorish Castle</h4>
            <p>Salobreña has an <a
            href="https://turismosalobrena.com/en/the-arab-castle/">old
            castle</a> that stems from moorish times. The entry is from
            the street <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZVwRxnXGWZmtKePm9">Calle
            Andrés Segovia</a>. It can be visited, and it’s quite
            worthwhile (fee should be around 4E with Monday evenings
            being free). There are some minor archeological excavations,
            and you will reach the only 360° viewpoint in town!</p>
            <p><img src="./img/andres-segovia.low.jpg" class="border rounded"></p>
            <p>While walking up to the castle, you’ll see <strong>Enno’s
            workshop</strong> on the left. Born in Germany, he’s been
            living and portraying Salobreña’s beauty for decades. You
            may want to check out his art.</p>
            <h4 id="viewpoints">Viewpoints</h4>
            <p><img src="./img/morente.jpg" class="border rounded" alt="Image by Angeles Andrade" /></p>
            <p>There are numerous <strong>viewpoints</strong> over the
            sea to the south, the “vega” to the east as well as the
            giant mountains to the north. Next to the house is the <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/y9VAA2PV24DXrZCZ7">viewpoint
            <strong>Mirador de Enrique Morente</strong></a> dedicated to
            the memory of one of the most prolific and internationally
            known Flamenco singers (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Morente">check
            him on Wikipedia</a>).</p>
            <p>Following up on the street Calle Estación on the way
            towards the Church and the main square, you’ll pass by the
            viewpoint <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kQZX2FFs9ohUmfF9A"><strong>Hoyo
            de la franscunda</strong></a>, from which you can observe
            the cliff below the castle and the bird population that
            inhabits it.</p>
            <p>From the <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ftirYyDpp57BsfmaA">main square
            of the old town</a>, right below the arcs of the old city
            hall, you can enjoy a view over the older parts of
            Salobreña’s old town.</p>
            <h4 id="beaches">Beaches</h4>
            <p>For a batch in the sea, you can enjoy the entire
            shoreline of Salobreña. The water gets refreshed frequently
            with currents from the Atlantic and it’s therefore a bit
            colder than the eastern parts of the Mediterranean. The
            water gets its most comfortable temperature around July and
            stays warm easily until the end of October.</p>
            <p>If you fancy more secluded beaches, do check out the <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3FAw7PDUxAesyfDa6">beach
            <strong>Playa de la cagailla</strong> or <strong>Punta del
            río</strong></a> to the east (you can walk along the beach
            or get there by car easily), or for the more adventurous you
            can try the west-most part of the bay and</p>
            <p>If by car, you can also enjoy the astonishing beaches in
            the Nature Reserve past Almuñécar (about 15-20 minutes by
            car). These beaches are a bit out of the radar, mostly due
            to the difficulty to reach, since there aren’t a lot of
            parking opportunities. In any case, I’ve linked them to
            places where’s usually easy to find a parking space. The
            first one is <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3FAw7PDUxAesyfDa6"><strong>Cantarriján</strong></a>
            (a nudist beach with dining options), which can only be
            accessed in high season by bus (tickets around 2E).</p>
            <p>Next, is <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hk4UfD7zGJA1W3SP6"><strong>el
            Cañuelo</strong></a>. You’ll have to walk down a bit on a
            dirt road until you reach its long and broad shore. Options
            for dining available.</p>
            <p>Further to the west, you’ll find <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2HEsHKAvhtRTi8K7"><strong>Cala
            Pino</strong></a>. Parking is next to the road. From there,
            you have to follow down a steep path. This beach can be
            followed to the west over rocks, which allows you to reach
            <strong>Playa Lapa</strong>.</p>
            <p>Finally, furthest to the west is <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/jEEx7NjYqvLfLZWbA"><strong>Playa
            del Molino</strong></a>. This beach features a small bathtub
            pool filled with natural water from a spring.</p>
            <h4 id="la-caleta">La Caleta</h4>
            <p><a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hmB4T1uWi7poMUus5"><em>La
            Caleta</em></a> is a nearby-town with an intriguing history.
            Up until the 60s and for several centuries, Salobreña’s main
            economic activity was <strong>sugar cane</strong>. In order
            to produce sugar from it, a factory was built in the 19th
            century in what is now La Caleta. Soon, the factory
            attracted a lot of workers who started building their homes
            nearby and slowly the town was consolidated. The factory is
            still very present, and the town is totally worth visiting.
            There’s been a recent outdoor photography exhibition
            “Caleteros” by local artists, which you can visit by just
            walking around the streets.</p>
            <h3 id="food">Food</h3>
            <p>There’s plenty to discover in the local gastronomy of
            Salobreña. I’ve listed my personal favorite places, both in
            and out of Salobreña. I hope you can find something to your
            taste.</p>
            <h4 id="within-walking-distance">Within walking
            distance</h4>
            <p>Despite its smaller size, Salobreña has a number of
            remarkable restaurants. My favorite is <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1cS7G4CdWEGT41Wq5"><strong>la
            Roka</strong></a>, on street Calle Estación, an
            award-winning restaurant with a mixture of traditional and
            modern cuisine and a lot of fusion. It also has an
            astonishing view of the sunset over the sea and a nice
            selection of cocktails. Often booked for weeks in advance,
            but make sure to try and get a spot.</p>
            <p>More traditionally minded are <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dz7XN6tNvN8LCa978"><strong>el
            Pesetas</strong></a> and <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GFz6VxFG5g3oYByb7"><strong>la
            Botica</strong></a>, where you can enjoy traditional and
            local plates and fried fish dishes, while enjoying their
            roof terraces with views over the town and surroundings.</p>
            <p>For a nice evening with food and a flamenco show, you can
            check <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DHwBHqBPK1hQPRuu5"><strong>la
            Traviesa</strong></a>. They usually have events on Monday
            evenings (although this may change, make sure to call, ask
            and book if interested).</p>
            <h4 id="at-the-beach">At the beach</h4>
            <p>There are a lot of restaurants along the seafront
            promenade (commonly known as “chiringuitos”) for you to
            choose. They often have a long menu of fish that you can
            usually order grilled (“a la plancha”) or fried (“frito”).
            For a more delicate and upscale menu, you should try <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hUTMkErPoj2dAtF49"><strong>el
            Verdejo</strong></a>. If you are fancying a more
            international dinner with pizza or hamburger, you can try
            out <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vhUcopZkME3dp2r98"><strong>La
            Bahía</strong></a>.</p>
            <p>If you are planning to visit <a href="#la-caleta">la
            Caleta</a>, you should check the grills of <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/jtV7DoeMQKPvzShg7"><strong>el
            Turrito</strong></a>, especially if you fancy a meat cut, or
            <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BvUXRoxoQ7k58jHcA"><strong>el
            Puentecillo</strong></a>. A personal favorite for fish food
            at the seashore are La Guardia’s <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dmzNUSL322SFv9aPA"><strong>Manolo</strong></a>
            and <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/UE9P7s81vG1twagL9"><strong>Rufino</strong></a>
            (with a more fusion and modern options).</p>
            <h4 id="getting-out">Getting out</h4>
            <p>Just out of Salobreña, there is a very nice upscale
            restaurant in the ground floor of the Hotel <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dUUqsdHUEXSAaq6Y6"><strong>MIBA</strong></a>.
            If you like cheesecake, you should definitely go and try
            theirs. I personally haven’t tried any better cheesecake.
            Besides that, you’ll be surprise at their delicacies and you
            can dine while enjoying the views over the shoreline. They
            also have a roof terrace to enjoy cocktails and drinks.</p>
            <p>Finally, if you are going to visit the beaches past
            Almuñécar, you should try and get a reservation for dinner
            at <a
            href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SaT2tBxmmimu3aAT9"><strong>Cerro
            Gordo</strong></a>, perhaps the best sunset view while
            dining in the region.</p>
